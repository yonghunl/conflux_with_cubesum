# conflux_with_cubesum

# there are two Matlab scripts to compare the performance Conflux w/ CubeSum to the performance of the original Conflux.
# 1. Livenss_attack_reaction2.m will outcome averaged reaction time fron the 100 times of repititions
# 2. Livenss_attack_plot.m will outcome the plot of the weight of the 1st longest chain and the 2nd longest chain.
# To generate the liveness attack, we assume that adversarial nods can attach either chain_A and chain_B to keep the balance of them
